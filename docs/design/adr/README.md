# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:
- Technology selection (database, framework, library)
- Architectural patterns (state management, API design)
- Cross-cutting concerns (authentication, logging, error handling)
- Data storage strategies
- Performance optimization approaches
- Security implementations

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[PROPOSED | ACCEPTED | REJECTED | DEPRECATED | SUPERSEDED]

## Context
What is the issue we're trying to solve?
What constraints exist?

## Decision
What decision did we make?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options did we evaluate?
Why were they rejected?

## Consequences
### Positive
What benefits does this decision bring?

### Negative
What drawbacks or trade-offs?

### Mitigation
How do we address the negative consequences?

## Implementation
How will this be implemented?

## Success Metrics
How will we know if this decision is working?
```

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [001](./adr-001-angular-state-management.md) | Angular State Management Pattern | ✅ ACCEPTED | 2025-10-24 |
| [002](./adr-002-http-interceptors.md) | HTTP Interceptor Strategy | ✅ ACCEPTED | 2025-10-24 |
| [003](./adr-003-change-detection-strategy.md) | Change Detection Strategy | ✅ ACCEPTED | 2025-10-24 |
| [004](./adr-004-project-structure.md) | Feature Module Architecture | ✅ ACCEPTED | 2025-10-24 |
| [005](./adr-005-user-preferences-storage.md) | User Preferences Storage Mechanism | ✅ ACCEPTED | 2025-10-24 |

## How to Use ADRs

1. **Before Implementation**: Check existing ADRs for guidance
2. **During Planning**: Create ADR for significant decisions
3. **Code Reviews**: Reference ADRs to justify architectural choices
4. **Onboarding**: New team members read ADRs to understand "why"
5. **Retrospectives**: Review ADR success metrics

## ADR Lifecycle

```
PROPOSED → Review → ACCEPTED → Implementation
                  ↓
              REJECTED (with reasoning)

ACCEPTED → Time passes → Issues discovered → DEPRECATED
                                           ↓
                                    New ADR SUPERSEDES old one
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep ADRs Immutable**: Don't edit accepted ADRs, create new ones that supersede
2. **Include Context**: Future you/team needs to understand the constraints
3. **Document Alternatives**: Show you considered multiple options
4. **Link to Issues**: Reference user stories, bugs, or requirements
5. **Be Honest**: Document both pros and cons
6. **Update Status**: Mark as DEPRECATED if decision changes
