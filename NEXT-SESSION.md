```
Hello Claude. I'm resuming work on the Autos2 project.

Project: Autos2 - Vehicle database application (Angular 14 + Node.js + Elasticsearch)
Location: /home/odin/projects/autos2
Git Branch: main
Production URL: http://autos2.minilab
Dev URL: http://192.168.0.244:4201 (use IP, not localhost)

Application Status: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION WORKING - Browse-First Pattern Complete
- Production: Running at http://autos2.minilab (‚úÖ v1.0.0-session6 deployed)
- Development: http://192.168.0.244:4201 (‚úÖ All features working)
- Backend API: http://autos2.minilab/api/v1 (2 replicas, healthy, CORS enabled)
- Dev Container: autos2-frontend-dev (running with /home/odin/projects/autos2/frontend:/app:z)

‚úÖ SESSION 6 COMPLETED:
- Implemented browse-first pattern (shows 20 vehicles on page load, no filter required)
- Added "Showing X-Y of Z vehicles" count display (right-aligned in card header)
- Fixed backend pagination ([nzFrontPagination]="false" - now shows 80 pages correctly)
- Fixed pagination race condition with setTimeout wrapper
- Removed unnecessary proxy configuration (Traefik handles routing)
- Fixed CORS to allow dev server access (CORS_ORIGIN: "*")
- Fixed totalPages mapping from backend snake_case (total_pages)
- Changed dev environment to use http://autos2.minilab/api/v1 directly
- Filter winnowing working (select manufacturer ‚Üí winnows to that manufacturer only)

üéØ PRIMARY GOAL FOR SESSION 7:
URL parameter sync for bookmarking and sharing:
- Sync filter state with URL query parameters (?manufacturers=Buick&page=1&size=20)
- Enable bookmarking of filtered views
- Enable sharing filtered searches via URL
- Restore filter state from URL on page load

Please orient yourself by reading:
1. NEXT-SESSION.md Session 6 section - See browse-first implementation
2. frontend/src/app/features/vehicles/services/vehicle-state.service.ts - State management
3. frontend/src/app/pages/discover/discover.component.ts - Component with working pagination

SECONDARY GOALS:
- Performance optimizations (trackBy functions for *ngFor loops)
- OnPush change detection (optional)
- Additional filter improvements (year range, multi-select)
```

### What Was Accomplished (Session 5 - 2025-10-25)

**Phase 2.2 Production Deployment & NG0900 Error Discovery:**
- ‚ùå Deployed Phase 2.2 to production, discovered NG0900 errors on Discover page
  - ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError preventing UI from rendering
  - Multiple errors in console related to loading$, manufacturers$, models$ observables
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Made 4 failed attempts to fix by deploying to k8s repeatedly (wrong approach)
  - User feedback: Redirected to use proper dev workflow with volume mounts
  - Learned: Backend is immutable (k8s), frontend developed in dev container with HMR

**Development Environment Setup:**
- ‚úÖ Set up proper dev container workflow
  - Started dev container with volume mount: /home/odin/projects/autos2/frontend:/app:z
  - Dev server running on port 4201 (port 4200 is old working app for comparison)
  - HMR provides instant feedback (edit ‚Üí save ‚Üí reload)
- ‚úÖ Created proxy configuration
  - frontend/proxy.conf.json forwards /api ‚Üí http://autos2.minilab/api
  - Dev server configured with --proxy-config flag
  - Enables API calls to work during development

**NG0900/NG0100 Error Fixes (ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError):**
- ‚úÖ Fixed LoadingService NG0100 errors
  - Wrapped show() and hide() BehaviorSubject updates in setTimeout()
  - Prevents state changes during change detection cycle
- ‚úÖ Fixed VehicleStateService NG0900 errors
  - Created updateState() helper method with setTimeout() wrapper
  - All 15+ BehaviorSubject.next() calls now wrapped in setTimeout()
  - Moved state updates outside Angular's change detection cycle
- ‚úÖ Fixed component initialization
  - Removed initialize() call from VehicleStateService constructor
  - Made initialize() public method called from DiscoverComponent.ngAfterViewInit()
  - Ensures change detection completes before state updates begin

**API Response Type Mismatches Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Manufacturers endpoint mismatch
  - Backend returns: `{manufacturers: [...], total: number}`
  - Frontend expected: `Manufacturer[]`
  - Added RxJS map() to extract manufacturers array
- ‚úÖ Models endpoint mismatch
  - Backend returns: `{manufacturer: string, models: [...], total: number}`
  - Frontend expected: `Model[]`
  - Added RxJS map() to extract models array
- ‚úÖ Vehicles endpoint mismatch
  - Backend returns: `{vehicles: [...], pagination: {...}}`
  - Frontend expected: `{data: [...], pagination: {...}}`
  - Added RxJS map() to transform response structure

**Interface & Field Name Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Updated Vehicle interface to match backend
  - Changed vin ‚Üí vehicle_id
  - Changed make ‚Üí manufacturer
  - Added data_source, ingested_at fields
- ‚úÖ Updated Manufacturer interface
  - Changed count ‚Üí vehicle_count and model_count
- ‚úÖ Updated Model interface
  - Changed count ‚Üí vehicle_count
  - Added year_range: {min, max} structure
- ‚úÖ Updated template field references
  - discover.component.html now uses correct field names
  - Simplified table to show: Vehicle ID, Year, Manufacturer, Model, Body Class

**Query Parameter Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed manufacturer filter parameter
  - Backend expects: manufacturers (plural, as array)
  - Frontend was sending: manufacturer (singular)
  - Updated VehicleService to use correct parameter names
  - Filter now works correctly (e.g., "Buick" shows 27 vehicles, not all 793)

**Internationalization:**
- ‚úÖ Configured English locale (NG-ZORRO)
  - Added NZ_I18N provider with en_US value
  - Eliminates Chinese text like "ÊöÇÊó†Êï∞ÊçÆ"
  - Now shows "No Data", "Select manufacturer", etc. in English

**Testing & Verification:**
- ‚úÖ All NG0900/NG0100 errors eliminated
- ‚úÖ Manufacturer dropdown populates correctly (70 manufacturers)
- ‚úÖ Vehicle table displays data correctly
- ‚úÖ Manufacturer filtering works (tested with Buick: 27 vehicles)
- ‚úÖ Pagination displays correctly
- ‚úÖ All API calls return 200/304 status codes
- ‚úÖ English UI throughout the application

**Git Commits:**

- frontend/proxy.conf.json (created for API proxying)

### What Was Accomplished (Session 6 - 2025-10-25)

**Browse-First Pattern Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Auto-load first 20 vehicles on page load without requiring filter selection
  - Search triggers automatically in ngAfterViewInit with empty filters
  - Users can immediately browse vehicles without selecting manufacturer
- ‚úÖ Added "Showing X-Y of Z vehicles" count display
  - Positioned in card header (right-aligned using nz-card [nzExtra])
  - Helper methods: getStartRecord() and getEndRecord() for pagination display
  - Shows "Showing 1-20 of 793 vehicles" dynamically
- ‚úÖ Filter winnowing working correctly
  - Select manufacturer ‚Üí table winnows to only that manufacturer's vehicles
  - Clear filters ‚Üí returns to showing all vehicles
  - Tested: Buick shows 27 vehicles (2 pages @ 20/page)

**Backend Pagination Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed pagination to show correct page count
  - Added [nzFrontPagination]="false" to enable backend pagination mode
  - Paginator now correctly shows 80 pages for 793 vehicles @ 10/page
  - Page size changes work: 10/page (80 pages), 20/page (40 pages), 50/page (16 pages)
  - Root cause: nz-table was using frontend pagination (only paginating the 10 items in [nzData])
- ‚úÖ Fixed totalPages mapping
  - Backend returns: total_pages (snake_case)
  - Frontend expects: totalPages (camelCase)
  - Added explicit field mapping in vehicle.service.ts
- ‚úÖ Fixed pagination race condition
  - changePageSize() was calling search() before state update completed
  - Wrapped search() call in setTimeout to ensure state updates first

**API Configuration Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Removed unnecessary proxy configuration
  - Deleted frontend/proxy.conf.json
  - Dev server no longer uses --proxy-config flag
  - Traefik/Ingress handles routing (as it should)
- ‚úÖ Fixed dev environment API URL
  - Changed from: apiUrl: '/api/v1' (relative - caused CORS issues)
  - Changed to: apiUrl: 'http://autos2.minilab/api/v1' (absolute)
  - Browser makes requests directly to autos2.minilab
  - Traefik routes to backend correctly
- ‚úÖ Fixed CORS configuration
  - Updated backend CORS_ORIGIN from "http://autos2.minilab" to "*"
  - Allows dev server at 192.168.0.244:4201 to access API
  - Production and dev both work correctly

**Production Deployment:**
- ‚úÖ Tagged v1.0.0-session6
