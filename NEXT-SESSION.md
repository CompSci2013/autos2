## Copy-Paste This to Start Next Session

```
Hello Claude. I'm resuming work on the Autos2 project.

Project: Autos2 - Vehicle database application (Angular 14 + Node.js + Elasticsearch)
Location: /home/odin/projects/autos2
Git Branch: main
Production URL: http://autos2.minilab
Dev URL: http://localhost:4201

Application Status: ‚úÖ DEVELOPMENT WORKING - Ready for Browse-First Pattern
- Production: Running at http://autos2.minilab (‚ö†Ô∏è needs deployment - has old NG0900 errors)
- Development: http://localhost:4201 (‚úÖ All fixes working - no errors)
- Backend API: http://autos2.minilab/api/v1 (2 replicas, healthy)
- Dev Container: autos2-frontend-dev (running with /home/odin/projects/autos2/frontend:/app:z)

‚úÖ SESSION 5 COMPLETED:
- Fixed all NG0900/NG0100 errors (ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError)
- Fixed all API response type mismatches (manufacturers, models, vehicles)
- Fixed interface field name mismatches (vehicle_id, manufacturer, vehicle_count, etc.)
- Fixed query parameter names (manufacturer ‚Üí manufacturers plural)
- Configured English locale for NG-ZORRO (eliminates Chinese text)
- Created proxy configuration for dev server
- Manufacturer filtering working correctly (tested: Buick shows 27 vehicles)
- All API calls returning 200/304 status codes
- Dev environment with HMR working properly

üéØ PRIMARY GOAL FOR SESSION 6:
Implement "browse-first" filter pattern:
- Table should show initial 20 vehicles WITHOUT requiring manufacturer selection
- Currently table is empty until user selects a manufacturer
- Auto-trigger search on page load with empty filters
- Add "Showing X-Y of Z vehicles" count display
- Test filter winnowing (select Ford ‚Üí winnows to Ford vehicles only)

Please orient yourself by reading:
1. frontend/src/app/features/vehicles/services/vehicle-state.service.ts - State management
2. frontend/src/app/pages/discover/discover.component.ts - Component initialization
3. NEXT-SESSION.md Session 5 section - See all fixes applied

SECONDARY GOALS:
- Deploy Session 5 fixes to production (build + k8s deployment)
- Consider URL parameter sync for bookmarking (like old app)
```

**Git Commits:**
- 42529a5: Implement Phase 2.2 - Migrate to Async Pipe Pattern (TD-004)

### What Was Accomplished (Session 5 - 2025-10-25)

**Phase 2.2 Production Deployment & NG0900 Error Discovery:**
- ‚ùå Deployed Phase 2.2 to production, discovered NG0900 errors on Discover page
  - ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError preventing UI from rendering
  - Multiple errors in console related to loading$, manufacturers$, models$ observables
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Made 4 failed attempts to fix by deploying to k8s repeatedly (wrong approach)
  - User feedback: Redirected to use proper dev workflow with volume mounts
  - Learned: Backend is immutable (k8s), frontend developed in dev container with HMR

**Development Environment Setup:**
- ‚úÖ Set up proper dev container workflow
  - Started dev container with volume mount: /home/odin/projects/autos2/frontend:/app:z
  - Dev server running on port 4201 (port 4200 is old working app for comparison)
  - HMR provides instant feedback (edit ‚Üí save ‚Üí reload)
- ‚úÖ Created proxy configuration
  - frontend/proxy.conf.json forwards /api ‚Üí http://autos2.minilab/api
  - Dev server configured with --proxy-config flag
  - Enables API calls to work during development

**NG0900/NG0100 Error Fixes (ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError):**
- ‚úÖ Fixed LoadingService NG0100 errors
  - Wrapped show() and hide() BehaviorSubject updates in setTimeout()
  - Prevents state changes during change detection cycle
- ‚úÖ Fixed VehicleStateService NG0900 errors
  - Created updateState() helper method with setTimeout() wrapper
  - All 15+ BehaviorSubject.next() calls now wrapped in setTimeout()
  - Moved state updates outside Angular's change detection cycle
- ‚úÖ Fixed component initialization
  - Removed initialize() call from VehicleStateService constructor
  - Made initialize() public method called from DiscoverComponent.ngAfterViewInit()
  - Ensures change detection completes before state updates begin

**API Response Type Mismatches Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Manufacturers endpoint mismatch
  - Backend returns: `{manufacturers: [...], total: number}`
  - Frontend expected: `Manufacturer[]`
  - Added RxJS map() to extract manufacturers array
- ‚úÖ Models endpoint mismatch
  - Backend returns: `{manufacturer: string, models: [...], total: number}`
  - Frontend expected: `Model[]`
  - Added RxJS map() to extract models array
- ‚úÖ Vehicles endpoint mismatch
  - Backend returns: `{vehicles: [...], pagination: {...}}`
  - Frontend expected: `{data: [...], pagination: {...}}`
  - Added RxJS map() to transform response structure

**Interface & Field Name Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Updated Vehicle interface to match backend
  - Changed vin ‚Üí vehicle_id
  - Changed make ‚Üí manufacturer
  - Added data_source, ingested_at fields
- ‚úÖ Updated Manufacturer interface
  - Changed count ‚Üí vehicle_count and model_count
- ‚úÖ Updated Model interface
  - Changed count ‚Üí vehicle_count
  - Added year_range: {min, max} structure
- ‚úÖ Updated template field references
  - discover.component.html now uses correct field names
  - Simplified table to show: Vehicle ID, Year, Manufacturer, Model, Body Class

**Query Parameter Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed manufacturer filter parameter
  - Backend expects: manufacturers (plural, as array)
  - Frontend was sending: manufacturer (singular)
  - Updated VehicleService to use correct parameter names
  - Filter now works correctly (e.g., "Buick" shows 27 vehicles, not all 793)

**Internationalization:**
- ‚úÖ Configured English locale (NG-ZORRO)
  - Added NZ_I18N provider with en_US value
  - Eliminates Chinese text like "ÊöÇÊó†Êï∞ÊçÆ"
  - Now shows "No Data", "Select manufacturer", etc. in English

**Testing & Verification:**
- ‚úÖ All NG0900/NG0100 errors eliminated
- ‚úÖ Manufacturer dropdown populates correctly (70 manufacturers)
- ‚úÖ Vehicle table displays data correctly
- ‚úÖ Manufacturer filtering works (tested with Buick: 27 vehicles)
- ‚úÖ Pagination displays correctly
- ‚úÖ All API calls return 200/304 status codes
- ‚úÖ English UI throughout the application

**Git Commits:**
- (Pending) fix: Resolve NG0900 errors with setTimeout wrapper pattern
- (Pending) fix: Correct API response type mismatches with RxJS map()
- (Pending) fix: Update interfaces to match backend field names

### Next Steps

**IMMEDIATE (Session 6):**
1. **Implement browse-first pattern** (PRIMARY GOAL from Session 5)
   - Table should show initial 20 vehicles WITHOUT requiring manufacturer selection
   - Currently table is empty until user selects a manufacturer
   - Auto-trigger search on page load with empty filters
   - Add "Showing X-Y of Z vehicles" count display
   - Test filter winnowing behavior (select Ford ‚Üí see only Ford vehicles)

2. **Deploy Session 5 fixes to production**
   - Build new frontend Docker image with all fixes
   - Deploy to k8s cluster
   - Verify NG0900 errors are resolved in production
   - Verify manufacturer filtering works in production

3. **URL parameter sync** (nice-to-have)
   - Old app had URL params like: `?manufacturers=Buick&page=1&size=20`
   - Enables bookmarking and sharing filtered views
   - Sync Angular router params with VehicleStateService

4. **Consider pagination improvements**
   - Current paginator shows page selector
   - Verify it works correctly with different manufacturers
   - Test page size changes (10, 20, 50, 100)

**FUTURE (Phase 2 completion):**
- Phase 2.3: OnPush change detection (optional)
- Phase 3: Type Safety improvements
- Phase 4: Performance optimizations (trackBy functions)

### Important Notes

- **Git workflow**: Commit frequently, push to `gitlab` remote
- **Documentation**: Update ADRs for significant decisions
- **BMAD framework**: Analysis ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Solutioning ‚Üí Implementation
