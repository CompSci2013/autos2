## Copy-Paste This to Start Next Session

```
Hello Claude. I'm resuming work on the Autos2 project.

Project: Autos2 - Vehicle database application (Angular 14 + Node.js + Elasticsearch)
Location: /home/odin/projects/autos2
Git Branch: main
Production URL: http://autos2.minilab

Application Status: DEPLOYED TO KUBERNETES ‚úÖ
- Frontend: http://autos2.minilab (2 replicas, nginx + Angular)
- Backend API: http://autos2.minilab/api/v1 (2 replicas, Node.js)
- Namespace: autos2
- Check pods: kubectl get pods -n autos2

Please orient yourself by reading these key files:
1. docs/design/angular-architecture.md - Architecture patterns and best practices
2. docs/design/improvement-roadmap.md - Phased improvement plan (currently on Phase 2)
3. k8s/ - Kubernetes manifests (namespace, deployments, services, ingress)

Session 2 Accomplishments:
‚úÖ Phase 1 (Critical Fixes) - COMPLETE
  - Subscription cleanup with takeUntil pattern
  - HTTP error interceptor with user notifications
  - Global loading interceptor and spinner
‚úÖ Kubernetes Production Deployment - COMPLETE
  - Production Dockerfiles created (multi-stage builds)
  - All services deployed to k8s cluster
  - Ingress configured with Traefik
  - Application verified working at http://autos2.minilab

Next Task: Begin Phase 2 - State Management (Week 2)

Phase 2 Goals:
- [ ] Create VehicleStateService with BehaviorSubject pattern (TD-003)
- [ ] Migrate components to use state service instead of direct API calls
- [ ] Migrate templates to async pipe pattern (TD-004)

Please review the roadmap and help me implement Phase 2.1
(Create Vehicle State Service) from docs/design/improvement-roadmap.md.

Let me know when you're oriented and ready to begin.
```

## Session Context

### What Was Accomplished (Session 1 - 2025-10-24)
- ‚úÖ Backend API implemented (Node.js + Express + Elasticsearch)
- ‚úÖ Frontend scaffolded (Angular 14 + NG-ZORRO)
- ‚úÖ Architecture documentation created (30,000+ words)
- ‚úÖ ADR system established
- ‚úÖ User preferences architecture decided (PostgreSQL JSONB)
- ‚úÖ Shutdown/startup procedures documented

### What Was Accomplished (Session 2 - 2025-10-25)

**Phase 1 - Critical Fixes (TD-001, TD-002):**
- ‚úÖ Implemented subscription cleanup with takeUntil pattern
  - Added ngOnDestroy to HomeComponent and DiscoverComponent
  - Created destroy$ Subject for proper cleanup
  - Applied takeUntil(destroy$) to all 6 subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Created HTTP error interceptor
  - Handles 401, 403, 404, 422, 5xx errors
  - Shows user-friendly NG-ZORRO notifications
  - Retries failed requests once
  - Logs errors to console for debugging
- ‚úÖ Created loading interceptor and service
  - LoadingService tracks active HTTP requests
  - LoadingInterceptor shows/hides spinner automatically
  - Global nz-spin component in app.component.html
  - Fixed ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError

**Kubernetes Production Deployment:**
- ‚úÖ Created production Dockerfiles
  - Backend: Multi-stage build (Node 18 Alpine, non-root user, 126MB)
  - Frontend: Multi-stage build (Node build + nginx Alpine, 50MB)
- ‚úÖ Created nginx.conf for frontend
  - Gzip compression, security headers, caching
  - SPA routing support (try_files)
- ‚úÖ Updated environment configs
  - Changed apiUrl to relative paths (/api/v1)
  - Works with ingress routing
- ‚úÖ Fixed Angular budget limits (1.5MB/2MB)
- ‚úÖ Deployed to Kubernetes
  - Namespace: autos2
  - Backend: 2 replicas, liveness/readiness probes
  - Frontend: 2 replicas, nginx serving
  - Services: ClusterIP for internal communication
  - Ingress: Traefik routing autos2.minilab
- ‚úÖ Verified production deployment
  - All 4 pods running healthy
  - DNS configured (autos2.minilab ‚Üí 192.168.0.110)
  - Full stack tested and working

**Git Commits:**
- dfebd03: Subscription cleanup
- 1b86399: HTTP error and loading interceptors
- 32ff742: Kubernetes deployment
- 123c37a: Session documentation (pending)

### Current State
- **Production**: http://autos2.minilab (Kubernetes, 4 pods running)
- **Development containers**: Stopped (no longer needed)
- **Git**: All work committed to main branch
- **Documentation**: Up-to-date

### Technical Debt Remaining
| Priority | Item | Effort | Status |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| ~~CRITICAL~~ | ~~Memory leaks~~ | ~~2 hrs~~ | ‚úÖ COMPLETE |
| ~~HIGH~~ | ~~No HTTP interceptors~~ | ~~4 hrs~~ | ‚úÖ COMPLETE |
| HIGH | No state management | 8 hrs | üéØ NEXT |
| HIGH | No async pipe usage | 4 hrs | üìã Planned |
| MEDIUM | No trackBy functions | 2 hrs | üìã Planned |

### Next Steps (Phase 2 - State Management)
1. **Create VehicleStateService** (TD-003) - START HERE
   - Implement BehaviorSubject pattern for manufacturers, models, vehicles
   - Add state persistence to localStorage
   - Handle loading state centrally
2. Refactor components to use VehicleStateService
3. Migrate templates to async pipe pattern (TD-004)

### Important Notes
- **Container-based development**: All npm/ng commands run via `podman exec`
- **Git workflow**: Commit frequently, push to `gitlab` remote
- **Documentation**: Update ADRs for significant decisions
- **BMAD framework**: Analysis ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Solutioning ‚Üí Implementation
